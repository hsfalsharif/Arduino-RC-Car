# Arduino RC Car

Basic implementation of a remote-controlled car using Arduino circuits. Wireless communication is done with radio frequency using **nRF24L01** modules. `rf_tx` is the transmission side code, and `rf_rx` is the receiving side respectively. Motor control is done using **L293D** mdoules.
